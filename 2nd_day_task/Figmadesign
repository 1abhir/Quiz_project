Day 2 – Figma UI Design Practice

Today I designed a Quiz Performance Dashboard UI in Figma as part of my daily design practice.
The goal was to improve my skills in UI layout, typography, color consistency, and dashboard UX design.

✨ Key Highlights:

Clean dashboard layout for quiz performance tracking

Sections for progress stats, quiz history, accuracy, and study streak

Modern card-based UI with soft shadows and gradients

Focus on usability, readability, and responsive structure

📌 Tools used: Figma
🎯 Focus: UI/UX design practice + dashboard visualization concepts

More designs coming soon — consistency is the goal 💪
